TypeScript is a programming language that is a superset of JavaScript.
It adds optional static typing to JavaScript, allowing developers to catch type errors at compile time and improve code quality.
TypeScript also provides features for organizing and reusing code, such as classes, interfaces, and modules.
IDEs and tools have better support for TypeScript, which can improve developer productivity and reduce errors.
TypeScript is especially useful for large-scale JavaScript projects where maintaining code can become challenging.
By addressing these issues, TypeScript can help make the development process faster, more efficient, and more reliable.
