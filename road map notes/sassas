to create sass
sass variable
$color:red

sass nesting

partials & import
partials mean part (mean css ke file ka parts)
_header.scss
mixins

@mixin mixins name ($value){
  border-radius:$value;
}
abs{
@include mixinsName(90px)

extend
if we have repeat some properties  
.abc{
color:red:
font-size:30px;
line:4px}
.xyz{
color:green
@extend .abc
 }
 
 %abc{
 color:red;
 fonst-size:6px;
 }
 .xyz{
 backgorund:blue;
@extend %abc}
it add the upper code abc here xyz
this is called palce holder it can not be see on css file 


operator in scss 
there are five types of operator in sass
equality
== 
!=

relational

numeric
string
boolean

interpolation
#{}
if we want to perform mathematicall expression then we used interpolation
margin-left:30xp
we can not perform mathematicall operation left side but using of interpolation we can do it

number
@function funName($value){
@return value/3 
}

string

.abc{
font-family:quote(arail)
font-family:unqoute()
font-family:to-upper-case("arial")
font-family:to-lower-case("arial")
font-family:str-length("arial")
font-family:str-index("arial","a")
to return index
font-family:str-insert("arial","add it before arail",10)

give you arail in this "arail"

font-family:str-slice("arial",3	8)
font-family:unique-id() it give 9 character string

color function
darken()
we can give it color and it convert the darken color 
background-color:darken(red,40)
lighten()
it can lighten the color
background-color:darken(red,40)
adjust-hue()
saturate()
color of lightness lata ha
desaturate()
color of darkness lata ha
mix()

transpatentize()


list in scss

In SCSS, a list is a data type that stores a collection of values. Lists are similar to arrays in other programming languages. A list in SCSS is represented as a comma-separated sequence of values, enclosed in parentheses.

$list :10px 10px 3px
$list :10px,10px,3px
$list :10px 10px 3px]

list of function
length()
nth()
here we can give index retrun value
nth() is a built-in function in SCSS that allows you to retrieve a specific element from a list, based on its position. The syntax for using nth() is as follows:
nth($list, $n)
set-nth()
join()
append()
index()
list-separator()
is-bracketed()
zip() join the two list by index


inbuild function

selector

there are seven selector in scss
selector-nest()
selector-append('a','b')
it can combine we can pass two parameter

selector-replace
selector-superselector
simple-selector
it can spearte the combine selector
selector-unify('a','.active')
it try to match the two selector

map function
is similar to list function but map can be key values
map-get()
map-merge()
map-remove()
map-keys()
map-values()
map-has-key()
#font-weight:("regular":400,"medium":500,bold:900)
map-get(map,key	)

introspection

In SCSS (Sass), introspection refers to the ability of a program to examine and manipulate its own internal structures, such as variables, mixins, and functions.

In SCSS, you can use introspection to query information about the current state of your stylesheets, and then use that information to generate dynamic styles or perform other programmatic task

variable-exists()
here parameter can pass it check the variable exsit are not
global-variable-exists()
mixin-exists()
function-exists()
type-of()
inspect() //it print the values a to z
@content
  
ChatGPT
In SCSS, the @content directive is used to pass a block of content to a mixin or a function, 

@media and @at-root

The @at-root directive is used to force a block of styles to be output at the root level of the CSS file, rather than nested inside another selector or rule. This is useful when you want to define a global style that applies to the entire page, regardless of the context or parent selector.
or 
in nesting if we want to the parent selector can not be show then we used at-root directivies used  

In SCSS, the @media directive is used to define a media query that applies a set of styles only when certain conditions are met. Media queries are used to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes, resolutions, or device capabilities. 




control directives of scss
@if
@els
@for(varaible from  1 through/to 2)

@each<var> in <list OR map>{}
