Authentication Strategies
Authentication strategies are methods or techniques used to verify the identity of a user or system in order to grant access to a protected resource. There are several different authentication strategies that can be used, including:

Basic Authentication
Session Based Authentication
Token Based Authentication
JWT Authentication
OAuth
SSO        

Basic Authentication

Basic authentication is the process of proving your identity by entering a username and password to access a resource, but it lacks strong security and encryption.

Basic Authentication include login
how it work 
the client tries to access some protected layer
sever checks if the request has authorization header with valid usernmae and password
then return status(200) else (401)




sesstion based authentication
user is assigned some unique identifer and this identifer is stored in server in memory .client sends  this sesstion id in all the request and server uses it to identify the user



SSO stands for Single Sign-On. It is an authentication method that allows users to log in once and gain access to multiple applications or systems without needing to provide their credentials again for each application.



OAuth (Open Authorization) is an authentication and authorization framework that allows users to grant third-party applications limited access to their resources on a web service without sharing their credentials directly.
