we used service work to need https server


the ExtendableEvent.waitUntil() method extends the lifetime of the event.

If you don't call it inside a method, the service worker could be stopped at any time (see the specification).

So, the waitUntil method is used to tell the browser not to terminate the service worker until the promise passed to waitUntil is either resolved or rejected.


beforeinstallpropmt event

About your specific questions:

In the case of the install and the activate events, it delays the state switch of the service worker to installed and activated (see the specification of the waitUntil method, in particular the last part of the paragraph).
I think the rest of my answer already answered as to why it is needed.

respondWith
The respondWith method is a method available in the FetchEvent interface within a service worker. It is used to provide a custom response to a fetch request.

manifest.json
is basically a .json which tells the browser about the website behavior
