CSS architecture refers to the organization and structure of CSS code within a project. It involves designing and implementing a consistent set of rules and conventions for naming classes, structuring files, and organizing CSS code to make it easier to read, maintain, and scale over time.

A well-designed CSS architecture can help to:

Improve code maintainability and scalability
Reduce code duplication and inconsistencies
Enhance code readability and understandability


BEM (Block Element Modifier) is a methodology and naming convention used in web development to create scalable and maintainable CSS code. It provides a standardized approach to naming classes, which helps in writing modular, reusable, and easy-to-understand code


why it is used

Scalability
Reusability
Readability
Modularity


Naming rules
block-name__elem-name_mod-name_mod-val

Names are written in lowercase Latin letters.

Words are separated by a hyphen (-).

The block name defines the namespace for its elements and modifiers.

The element name is separated from the block name by a double underscore (__).

The modifier name is separated from the block or element name by a single underscore (_).

The modifier value is separated from the modifier name by a single underscore (_).

For boolean modifiers, the value is not included in the name.



A preprocessor is a software tool that allows developers to write code in a language that is easier to read and write, and then converts it into another language that can be executed by a computer.
