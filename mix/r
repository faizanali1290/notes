one to one relation ship


One way to model a one-to-one relationship in MongoDB is to use embedded documents. In this approach, you can store all the data for both entities in a single document. For example, let's say you have two entities, a user and a profile. You can embed the profile document inside the user document, like this:

 one to many
 many to many
 
  
 
 
 db.user.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "posts",
      localField: "_id",
      foreignField: "user_id",
      as: "posts"
    }
  }
])
