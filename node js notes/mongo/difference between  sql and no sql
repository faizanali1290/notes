Data Structure: SQL databases have a fixed schema, which means that the structure of the data must be defined before the data is inserted. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, have a dynamic schema and can handle unstructured data.

Query Language: SQL databases use SQL as their query language, while NoSQL databases use a variety of query languages, depending on the type of database.

Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable, meaning that they can handle more load by adding more resources (such as RAM or CPU) to a single server. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, meaning that they can handle more load by adding more servers to a cluster.
