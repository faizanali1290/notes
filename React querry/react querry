react querry 
is used to manage asynchonously manage data

import {useQuery} from 'react-query'
this is hook that is used to manage async manage data

why we give key beacuse to store on cache we need key
if we have multiple forexmple 100user can be iterate  useQuerry(["post",gicveUnique])
const {data,status}=useQuerry("the first is the key",andthe second arrgument is the async function ,faizan,{
last arrgument represent the congig
staleTime:2000

this mean that when we can go other tab it can be update data  2000 milisecond



retry:
cacheTime:1000
it mean that how much time the cache data can be clean
onSuccess:()=>console.log("successfully send data
onError:()=>console.log("error


})





react querry dev tool 

npm i --save react-qurry-tool










async function(){
}
const {data,status}=usequerry([ne",9,],fetchdata)
here we can pass some value it can be get on function fetchdata(fristdata,seconddata) it would helpful in pagination
