"Hello, my name is Faizan, and I am a full-stack developer from Danyore. I have completed my FSc with ICS and learned full-stack development at UConnect. I have a strong understanding of front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, and have experience using React.js to build responsive and user-friendly web applications. I also have experience with backend technologies, which include Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. This knowledge allows me to create efficient and scalable web applications from end to end.
