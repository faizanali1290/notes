A Git repository is a directory that tracks and stores a project's files, along with their complete history of changes. It allows developers to collaborate, create branches for new features, revert to previous versions, and synchronize code with remote servers. Git repositories enable efficient version control and facilitate seamless team collaboration in software development.
