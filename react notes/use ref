use ref


useRef is a hook in React that provides a way to access and persist a value across multiple renders. 


problem 
useEffect without dependencies array to check how many time it can be render 


use if ref
it create a mutable variable which will not re-render the components
it access the dom element directly

useref can return the object

const count=useref()
count.current


< rf={give me a varaible name to store useref()}  button>
