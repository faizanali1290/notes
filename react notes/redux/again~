when to usd redux

Big APplication
High frequency of state of change

redux pattern
 in redux three thing melkay make new state
 
 prev state
 payload 
 action
 14:00
 
 middleware
 npm i redux-logger
 // it give  prev state 
 // it give action 
 // it give next state
  applyMiddleware(logger,thunk)||
  
  action can be a simple object it can not be handle async programing  
  for a specific work it can be stop and get that disptach again that this thing give us 
  provide redux-thunk
  and we need change the code
  inside dispatch we can call this not this dispatch(incr())
  dispatch(incr)
   and async thunk give inside dispatch(incr) function
  give this
  
  async function incr(dispatch ,getState)
 {
 data await
 return {type:init,payload:data}
 
 }

 inside store we have three thing
 (1) state {is a object or nested object it how much nest it depend the how much reducer  }
 (2) reducer
 (3) dispatch
 how work store
 store tell you directly state using usegetstate()
 when we want to change the state the we called the dispatch sa we sent action to the reducer 
 combination of reducer and action it can create new state in the mid of present middleware

 redux toolkit
 it create automatically action creater
 it give you a reducer .reduxer with expect the redux
 give utilize of slices===reducer
 
 
 
 const bounce=createSlice({
 //here the name is similar to "here/reducerInsideName" beffore
 name:"increment" //const incre="increment/appp"
 
 })
 
 
 
 const store=configureStore({ // it is similar to  combine reducer
 
 reducer:{
 
 }
 })

 using create reducer and create action we can create coustom reducer and action  
 
 
 extraReducer add additional 
 
 
 
 
 createAsync thunk
