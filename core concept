A browser is a software application that allows you to access and view information on the internet, such as web pages, images, videos, and other content. It interprets and displays web-related technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and provides a user interface for navigating the web and interacting with online content. Examples of popular browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari.
